# Session 2

There are functions which are continuous everywhere but aren't differentiable. This was found by **Weierstrass**. These functions aren't really easy to be graphed.

The real art of real analysis is to identify, observe an tackle down the very way you think and that is the most important thing or skill in order to improve at real analysis.

**Reflexive**: a is always equals to a.

**Symmetric**: Provided that a is same as b, then this also states b is same as a

**TRansitive**: If a is same as b and b is same as c then a should be same as c

**Substitution**: If $$y = x^2$$ and x = z then $$ y = z^2 $$ and one can substitute one with other.

*** Exercise before the subtraction was defined ***

Q 4.1.1 (->)  Verify that the definition of equality on the integers is both reflexive and symmetric

sol: 

To prove reflexive behavior, we are required to prove a = a. Lets start,

$$ a = a $$
$$ => ( a - 0 ) = ( a - 0 ) $$
$$ or a + 0 = a + 0 $$
$$ thus, a = a $$ 

To prove symmetricity, 

Given, ( a - b ) = ( a' - b' ) 

or $$ a + b' = a' + b $$

Show, -( a - b ) = - ( a' - b' )
$$or ( b - a ) = ( b' - a' ) as -(a-b) = (b-a) and -n = -(n-0) = (0-n)$$

$$ so, b + a' = b' + a $$
$$ or a + b' = a' + b $$

Q 4.1.3) Prove -1*a = -a for all a belonging to integers

sol: -1*a = -a

then, $$ -(1-0)(a-0) = (0-1)(a-0) $$
or $$ (0a+1*0) - (0*0 + 1*a) $$ as $$ (a-b)*(c-d) = (ac+bd) - (bc+ad) $$
or $$ 0 - (a) = -a $$ ( from definition)

Hence proved.

Q 4.1.4 ) Solve by solving additive associativity and check.

Q 4.1.5 ) Prove if ab = 0 then a or b or both a and b is 0.

sol:

Q 4.1.6 ) Prove cancellation. i.e., a\*c = b\*c for c != 0.

sol:
